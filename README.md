## Introduction
This is a code of a plasma simulation using the particle-in-cell (PIC) method. PIC is a method of simulating plasma with giant particles and discretizing fields into meshes[^1]. This code aims to simulate collisionless plasma with an ion-electron PIC code based on Matlab. The code is initialized as a hydrogen electron code, the user can change ion mass and charge by changing mi and e_i

`
mi = 1.67e-27 % kg
`
for ion mass and
`e_i = e0 * number_represent %Charge of a ion
`
for ion charge
